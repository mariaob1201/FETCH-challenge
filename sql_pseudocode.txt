'''
Our partner, Pepsi, has seen heavy national sales loss during the US holiday months
(OCT - DEC).
They have seen loyalty data from Target's RED Loyalty Program that shows Pepsi's
best customers bought less during the most recent holiday season.
Pepsi is worried that what they see in Target's loyalty data is also what is
causing their national sales dip. Can we use our data to confirm their findings?
