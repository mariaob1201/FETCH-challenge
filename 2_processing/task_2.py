Second: provide SQL queries

Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.

Closed-ended questions:

What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?
What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation? (*)

Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.

Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category? (*)
At what percent has Fetch grown year over year? (*)

# I am assuming

# This mean getting the data from transactions, users and products, will use the merged data from eda.ipynb

#summ=users_transactions[users_transactions['TIME_AS_USER_WHEN_PURCHASING_MO']>6].groupby('BRAND')['FINAL_SALE'].sum().reset_index()
